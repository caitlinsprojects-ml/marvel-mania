    "I took CSE 8A and 3 weeks of CSE 8B in Fall 2019 and Winter 2020 respectively. I chose to take a dataset and using that set create a game to allow people to guess what Marvel movie a certain number of lines of dialagoue were from. I challenged myself by learning how to import the data and make it usable/readable and how to get a specific number of lines from it while still getting lines from a random portion of the script and taking bounds into consideration. I researched how to use global variables and how to \"reset\" a game so that the mmain function would continue to cycle through the list of movies randomly, and I also taught myself how to use a mock unit test with some stackoverflow code and how to manipulate it into making other mocks besides a mock input. I attempted to learn how to use the signal package in Python, but was unsuccessful in getting it to work with my project."
